**STOP OLD NORTH STATE FROM MAKING THE BRIAR CHAPEL COMMUNITY A REGIONAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY**

Dear Residents of Briar Chapel,

Do you want a Regional Waste Water Treatment Facility for Northern Chatham County processing a million gallons of waste a day in your Community? This waste water will be disseminated in our backyards and/or dumped into our waterways?

**Old North State Water Company aka Envirolink aka Old North State Water Company (ONSWC) North Chatham the current owner and operator of the Briar Chapel Waste Water Plant is seeking approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission to expand operations to include Fearrington “and other surrounding communities” and commercial development. In addition, they want to increase the plant’s capacity to a million gallons a day.**

We currently use reclaimed water from the sewage plant to irrigate our parks and yards. Our service provider, ONSWC, fails to perform in accordance with State and Federal regulations. Briar Chapel continuously experiences sewage spills, excessive odors, over spraying, erosion, sink holes, etc., Old North State currently processes approximately 200, 000 gallons per day. They are proposing to increase the capacity to 1,000,000 gallons per day integrating sewage from Fearrington Village and other developments both residential and commercial. ONSWC is actively pursuing the Briar Chapel Community as a **REGIONAL SEWAGE FACILITY FOR ALL OF NORTH CHATHAM COUNTY**.

**IF BRIAR CHAPEL BECOMES A REGIONAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT ALL OF OUR HOME VALUES WILL IMMEDIATELY PLUMMET.**

**(1)We need all the residents of Briar Chapel to ENGAGE IMMEDIATELY**. Please talk to your neighbors and if they didn’t receive this notice please ask them to send their information to our community email account established for this purpose: [Stopchathamnorth@gmail.com](mailto:Stopchathamnorth@gmail.com)

(2)**ATTEND CRITICAL Meetings:**

**Saturday, January 18, 2020 @ 10:30 AM :** At the Briar Chapel Club House all homeowners are invited. At this meeting we will organize community outreach to **FIGHT this proposal**.

**Tuesday, January 21, 2020 @ 6:00 PM:** This is a Planning Meeting also at the Historic Courthouse. Chatham County will be considering a revision to the Chatham County Policy and Strategy enabling private companies to **establish regional waste water treatment facilities in densely populated areas like Briar Chapel.**

**Wednesday, January 22, 2020 @ 10:00 AM**: North Carolina Utilities Commission Meeting, 430 N Salisbury Street, Commission Hearing Room 2115, 2nd Floor. At this meeting expert testimony will be presented. We can’t testify at this meeting but our presence will **make a difference**. We have been advised that we NEED TO RETAIN A UTILITIES ATTORNEY. The attorney would be able to provide expert testimony requesting a “waiver for good cause” effectively delaying this to allow us time to refute it. If we are able to retain legal counsel we will reach out for community for financial support. The HOA counsel can NOT REPRESENT HOMEOWNERS they only represent the Association and therefore cannot fund an attorney for the Homeowners.

**WE NEED TO UNITE TO STOP THIS NOW!**
