**StopChathamNorth**

To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

We’d like to thank all of you who responded so quickly to our email yesterday. We are firmly committed to moving forward with the November 16th CC Board of Commissioner’s meeting and continuing to act as watchdog on this issue for the residents of Briar Chapel.

**StopChathamNorth Legal Standing**

After the October 19th Chatham County Board of Commissioner’s Meeting, legal counsel for the BCCA, Hope Carmichael, published a notice to all Briar Chapel residents stating that “Stop Chatham North is a movement, not a legally formed entity.” StopChathamNorth legal counsel, Dwight Allen, has advised us that this is not correct and he has advised the Chatham County Commissioner’s accordingly ([Mr. Allen’s letter dated October 28, 2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q2Fyn_mWnVGbW0o0WJviZ-fel35vQZZn/view?usp=sharing)). It is important to note that in Mr. Allen’s letter he also points out Newland’s responsibility for odor control issues.

In his letter, Mr. Allen states:

“To be clear and without doubt, StopChathamNorth has legal authority to act on behalf of its members, N.C. Gen. Stat. 59B-8(a) states, “A nonprofit association, in its name, may institute, defend, intervene, or participate in a judicial, administrative, or other governmental proceeding or in an arbitration, mediation, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution.” Additionally, N.C. Gen. Stat. 59B-5(c) states, “A nonprofit association may be a beneficiary of a trust or contract or a devisee.” In fact, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), which has all the powers and jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction, specifically recognized that StopChathamNorth is organized as an unincorporated nonprofit association under Chapter 59B.”

It is important to remember why StopChathamNorth formed.

In January 2020, the BCCA Board of Directors informed the Briar Chapel residents that they could not represent the interests of the homeowners in opposing a Regional Wastewater system to be located in the middle of the Briar Chapel Community. StopChathamNorth was organized at the urging of the BCCA President, Tom Speer, to represent the residents of Briar Chapel. The BCCA sent an [email to the residents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RWKKMSpyAQrTn2HhIcNW4OqdWx1fOW8l/view?usp=sharing) following the January 30th BCCA Board of Directors Meeting stating:

“It is important to note BCCA’s responsibilities do not include the personal houses and property owned by the homeowner members of BCCA.”

Despite the stance of the BCCA Board of Directors on homeowner representation, SCN remains committed to representing the interest of the SCN members and we appreciate the opportunity to continue to serve this community.

**Mission Statement**

StopChathamNorth is an unincorporated non-profit association representing concerned homeowners within Briar Chapel. **StopChathamNorth does NOT support a regional wastewater treatment plant within the residential community of Briar Chapel.** We are aware that there are several new communities surrounding Briar Chapel that are planning to utilize our WWTP, in addition to the current proposal to add Fearrington Village to our WWTP. We are opposed to all of these plans to expand Briar Chapel’s WWTP for uses outside of the Briar Chapel residential community. We also believe that the WWTP and ONSWC must be fully compliant with all governance and regulatory guidelines to ensure operations do not create a nuisance, unhealthy or hazardous conditions for Briar Chapel residents.
