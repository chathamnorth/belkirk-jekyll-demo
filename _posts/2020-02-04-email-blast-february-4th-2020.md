To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

In the interest of keeping you informed, there are a few updates we’d like to share.

· Tonight, Tuesday, February 4th at 6:30pm there is a Chatham County Planning Board meeting that will be held at the Chatham County Agriculture and Conference Center located at 1192 US 64 Business in Pittsboro. The [agenda](https://www.chathamnc.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=47488) for this meeting includes a follow-up from the Jan. 21st Chatham County Commissioners meeting to discuss an amendment to the Chatham County Comprehensive Plan. Based on input Briar Chapel residents provided at the Jan. 21st meeting, the Planning Board has recommended revisions to the Comprehensive Plan which clarify public utilities as government-owned, operated and maintained, so that privately owned waste water treatment facilities such as Briar Chapel’s facility would not be included in this planning strategy. For more details, see the [proposal.](https://www.chathamnc.org/home/showdocument?id=47496) Several members of our Task Force are planning to attend to tonight’s meeting to monitor the discussion.

· We are pleased to announce that we have retained Dwight Allen of Allen Law Firm to represent the homeowners of Briar Chapel and this week are meeting with him to provide him information that we have gathered to date. With the combination of the Brough Law Firm’s expertise in Land Use and the Allen Law Office’s expertise in Utilities, we believe these attorneys can work together to ensure Briar Chapel’s BCCA and homeowner’s interests are well represented.

We’d like to thank everyone who has already donated towards the cost of legal representation. We have funded the retainer for the attorney and are working towards sufficient funds to cover us through the NC Utilities Commission Evidentiary Hearing through to final decision. If you haven’t had a chance to make a donation yet, please consider doing this. We’ve had questions from many of you asking for help in determining a suggested donation. We want people to contribute what they can, but a minimum of $100 will greatly help in paving the way toward funding for the longer term.

You can write a check to: STOPCHATHAMNORTH and mail it to: STOPCHATHAMNORTH in care of Terri Burrell, 78 Middleton Place, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 or simply drop the check at Terri’s house.

We are maintaining a full accounting of these funds and will return any unused funds to all homeowners who contribute on a prorated basis.

Thank you again for contributing. If we all work together, we have a better chance of achieving our goals.
