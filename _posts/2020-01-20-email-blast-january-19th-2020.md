**StopChathamNorth**

To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

We would like to introduce ourselves as the **Briar Chapel Stop Chatham North Task Force** which is composed of concerned residents who are willing to stand up to serve our community. We are as follows: Donna Sukkar, Terri Burrell, Diane Crompton, Rusty Fields, Jim Flood, Liz Rolison, Kathy Tawney, Pat Van Hoy.

As a follow-up to our meeting yesterday, we are providing information related to what **you can do** as a Briar Chapel resident to stop the approval of Old North State expanding operations to make Briar Chapel a regional wastewater facility:

**1. Attend the Chatham County Board of Commissioner’s meeting this Tuesday, Jan. 21st.   
 **This is a regularly scheduled meeting, which will provide an opportunity for us, as BC homeowners, to show up and speak.

**Meeting details:**

**Date:** Tuesday, Jan. 21st

**Time:** 6:00 p.m. (there is a work session preceding this at 4:00 p.m., with the regular session starting at 6:00 p.m.)

**Location:** Historic Chatham County Courthouse  
 [9 Hillsboro Street, Second Floor Courtroom  
 Pittsboro, North Carolina 27312](http://www.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=9+Hillsboro+Street%2c+Pittsboro%2c+North+Carolina+27312 "9 Hillsboro Street, Second Floor Courtroom
Pittsboro, North Carolina 27312")

**Details:**

· If you want to speak/testify, you can sign up online (see link below, use the 2nd link) to speak or on site, immediately prior to the 6:00 session. If you plan on speaking please bring a written copy of your testimony to provide to the Commissioners. Plan on speaking for no more than 3 minutes.

**Pre-planning:**  
 Transportation: if you don’t have a ride to this event, please be at the Briar Chapel Clubhouse by 5:00 p.m. If you have room in your car for other riders, please consider taking others.

Arrival time: Please plan on being at the courthouse by 5:45. This will give you time to park and also sign up on site to speak.

Please check in with a Briar Chapel point of contact upon entering the event (will be at the door to the meeting room). We are working on getting ribbons/pins to wear to signify unity and that we are residents at Briar Chapel.

**Speaking points:** Recommendations for speaking points are below:

· This initiative to turn Briar Chapel into a Regional Wastewater Treatment facility, was not communicated to the homeowners of Briar Chapel by Chatham County, the HOA or developers.

· Old North State has failed to meet existing standards of compliance, management and accountability with their existing operations. We, as homeowners have no confidence that they would be able to meet the demands of the significantly increased capacity of 1 million gallons of sewage per day, this is over 4x the volume of our current operations.

· This change in operations is monumental from an environmental perspective and one that has irreparable harm to environmental, health, and quality of life impact as well as devaluing our properties.

Decorum: It’s not looked upon favorably to create disturbance in these sessions. By demonstrating respect for the setting and people (Commissioners), we will be perceived in the best light.

**2. Attend the meeting of the North Carolina Utilities Commission this Wednesday, January 22nd.   
 **This is an evidentiary meeting, which will not provide us an opportunity to testify, however we can show up in force to demonstrate our unity and presence.

**Meeting details:**

**Date:** Wednesday, Jan. 22nd

**Time:** 10:00 a.m.

**Location:** 430 North Salisbury Street, Commission Hearing Room 2115, 2nd floor

**Details:**

This meeting is a response to the public hearing this past Tuesday in Pittsboro with the North Carolina Utilities Commission and representatives of Old North State. The lawyer representing Old North State will be expected to respond to issues we (the residents of Briar Chapel) raised in the Tuesday hearing. Likewise, our public agent (attorney supplied by the county) will be representing us. We are hopeful that we will also have counsel beyond the Public Agent representing us at this hearing. The hearing will include expert testimony from architects, engineers, etc. to support either party.

**Pre-planning:**  
 Transportation: If you don’t have a ride to this event, please be at the Briar Chapel Clubhouse by 8:30 a.m. If you have room in your car for other riders, please consider taking others.

Arrival time: Please plan on being at this location before 9:00. This will give you time to park.

Please check in with a Briar Chapel point of contact upon entering the event (will be at the door to the meeting room). We are working on getting ribbons/pins to wear to signify unity and that we are residents at Briar Chapel.

Decorum: It’s not looked upon favorably to create disturbance in these sessions. By demonstrating respect for the setting and people (Commissioners), we will be perceived in the best light.
