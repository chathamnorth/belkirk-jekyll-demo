To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

**Public Hearing for Williams Corner Rezoning is being Postponed**

The public hearing for the Williams Corner rezoning proposal originally scheduled for this Monday, March 16th at 6:00pm has been postponed until Monday, April 20th at 6:00pm due to concerns about large gatherings. The Chatham County Commissioners will still be meeting this Monday, but they will vote to defer the public hearing until April 20th.

As a brief reminder this rezoning proposal calls for **off-site treatment of wastewater and off-site disposal of treated wastewater by Old North State Water Company (referring to the Briar Chapel WWTP)**. When we get closer to the rescheduled date we will send you more information about the public hearing and how you can reach out to your county commissioners.

In an effort to heed the Governor’s recommendations on large gatherings, the Chatham County Board of Commissioners will hold an abbreviated meeting on Monday, March 16, 2020 at 6:00 PM at the Agriculture and Conference Center, 1192 US 64 Business W, Pittsboro. The meeting will provide a brief opportunity for public comment but we would like to ask the public to defer any public comment to the April 20, 2020 BOC meeting. At the March 16th meeting the BOC will vote on a request to continue all public hearings from the March meeting to the April 20, 2020 BOC meeting.

**Petition to Oppose the Williams Corner Rezoning Proposal**

Below is a link to a petition opposing the Williams Corner Rezoning Proposal. SCN is not for or against growth in Chatham County. However, since Williams Corner is proposing to use ONSWC for offsite wastewater treatment and offsite disposal of treated wastewater (using Briar Chapel’s facility), we are opposing the rezoning proposal.
