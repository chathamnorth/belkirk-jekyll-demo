To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

We want to alert residents to an active sewage spill at the dog park on Great Ridge Parkway by Pump Station A. The area is now taped off and should be avoided.

We got notification this morning and arrived at 9:00am. At that time, it was clear the spill had been going on for some time. ([Video of the full extent of the spill](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuPKaQLk5oVFG6tHRNJ-iOFmgyRfcXq3/view?usp=sharing)). The dog park is saturated and then flows down the sidewalk to the walking trail up to the bridge and into Pokeberry Creek. Unfortunately, as we arrived there were people/pets in the dog park and families coming up through the trail that we had to alert to the spill. The spill appears to have started last night (a resident has sent us [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O7C0KN8CTqx_4X-sKf_CAG2b4nxmplm8/view?usp=sharing) from last night and tells us that he notified Integra Water at that time). A person from our new operator had arrived this morning and was working on getting men and equipment in to fix what appears to be another pipe break.

We have now had 30 sewage spills. Our wastewater system is unstable. This is why we continue to push for a delay in approving Newland’s final plat approvals. Until the proposed forcemain bypass is implemented and proven to work, adding more development to our unstable system will continue to make these problems worse.

**Mission Statement**

StopChathamNorth is an unincorporated non-profit association representing concerned homeowners within Briar Chapel. **StopChathamNorth does NOT support a regional wastewater treatment plant within the residential community of Briar Chapel.** We are aware that there are several new communities surrounding Briar Chapel that are planning to utilize our WWTP, in addition to the current proposal to add Fearrington Village to our WWTP. We are opposed to all of these plans to expand Briar Chapel’s WWTP for uses outside of the Briar Chapel residential community. We also believe that the WWTP and ONSWC must be fully compliant with all governance and regulatory guidelines to ensure operations do not create a nuisance, unhealthy or hazardous conditions for Briar Chapel residents.
