To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

Tonight’s virtual Town Hall is devoted to answering our questions on ongoing negotiations between the HOA Board, Newland and ONSWC.

**It is our understanding that Tom Speers has excluded Shelley Colbert and Jim Proper in tonight’s virtual Town Hall – we are concerned that Shelley and Jim have raised concerns that the HOA Board does not want to have aired at this evening’s meeting.**

The purpose of tonight’s Town Hall is to allow residents to submit their questions to be answered by the HOA Board. The HOA attorney, Hope Carmichael, will select the questions and read them (often paraphrasing or grouping questions). This format allows the HOA to decide which questions they want to answer and does not ensure that all questions are included. It is unfortunate that our HOA Board is not allowing a free exchange of comments and dialogue on this issue.

We encourage you to attend either tonight’s virtual Town Hall or tomorrow night’s HOA Board Meeting. These two meetings will give you a chance to ask your questions or provide input to the HOA Board on their recent negotiations with Newland and ONSWC ([Framework of Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UJFNsDCW04nhFaGHk9HX3kRNFgj0DJAG/view?usp=sharing)).

**Virtual HOA Town Hall – October 13th 7pm**

Briar Chapel residents have an opportunity to ask questions of the HOA Board at their virtual Town Hall (Tuesday, October 13th at 7pm). Unfortunately, you will not be able to speak, but this is an opportunity to get your questions answered about the HOA Board’s recent actions in negotiating a Framework of Agreement with Newland and ONSWC.

**Mission Statement**

StopChathamNorth is an unincorporated non-profit association representing concerned homeowners within Briar Chapel. **StopChathamNorth does NOT support a regional wastewater treatment plant within the residential community of Briar Chapel.** We are aware that there are several new communities surrounding Briar Chapel that are planning to utilize our WWTP, in addition to the current proposal to add Fearrington Village to our WWTP. We are opposed to all of these plans to expand Briar Chapel’s WWTP for uses outside of the Briar Chapel residential community. We also believe that the WWTP and ONSWC must be fully compliant with all governance and regulatory guidelines to ensure operations do not create a nuisance, unhealthy or hazardous conditions for Briar Chapel residents.
