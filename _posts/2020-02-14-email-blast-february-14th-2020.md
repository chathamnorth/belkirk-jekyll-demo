To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

It’s been a busy week and there are a number of updates and information that we’d like to share.

**Full Court Press – Contact Envirolink**

**It’s important to document any concerns or complaints** that you personally experience with the Briar Chapel wastewater management system (odor, runoff, spills, spray effluent pooling) by writing to Envirolink. **Just a simple email** works, phone calls do not provide the necessary documentation. We know that many of you have stopped calling because the response you have received from Envirolink in the past has been inadequate, but it is imperative that we continue this effort and build a record of your complaints. We also know that you experience some of these conditions over and over (i.e., odor) but again it is important to document these concerns each time you experience them.

To track these concerns, we ask that you email your concern to [lbowman@envirolinkinc.com](mailto:lbowman@envirolinkinc.com) and copy (cc) us at [STOPCHATHAMNORTH@gmail.com](mailto:STOPCHATHAMNORTH@gmail.com). Likely you will be asked to call the Envirolink customer service number 252-235-4900. We recommend you do both. The call will not provide us with the necessary documentation to compile data, so we ask that you also send the email. Your concern will **only** be tracked if you send the email.

Note, Envirolink is eager to meet with residents in order to meet their commitment to the NCUC addressing the concerns that our HOA Board and residents raised at the January 14th public hearing. In some cases, we’ve heard of Envirolink coming to resident’s homes unannounced. It is your decision as a resident on whether you want to participate in those meetings.

**Synopsis of Events**

**Media**

Chatham News + Records has run an excellent series of articles on the Briar Chapel WWTP issues we’ve been experiencing. Here’s the link to their latest article, published on 2/14/2020: [http://bit.ly/37uKP8K](http://bit.ly/37uKP8K "http://bit.ly/37uKP8K") Note, in today’s article, Envirolink defends their customer service record and responsiveness to customer issues. This is all the more reason to document your concerns as we’ve recommended.

Chapelboro has also reprinted articles from the Chatham News + Record.

The Daily Tarheel is working on an article that should be coming out shortly. They have done interviews with us and received a tour of the residential area around our WWTP.
