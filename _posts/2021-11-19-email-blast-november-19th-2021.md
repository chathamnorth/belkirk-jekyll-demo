**StopChathamNorth (SCN)**  
 To the Residents of Briar Chapel,  
   
 In this email you will find information about:

1. Latest updates from the Tri-Party Council.
2. Chatham County Board of Commissioner’s (CCBOC) meeting regarding Fearrington Preserve applying for development under the Compact Community Ordinance (CCO) and its potential impact on Briar Chapel’s wastewater system.
3. Appointments to the Wastewater Study Commission (by Chatham County Board of Commissioners).
4. Recap of the presentation “Living with a WWTP and Reclaimed Water,” offered at Breakaway on November 14th and again on November 21st from 4-6 pm.

**Updates from the Tri-Party Council**  
   
 Following are notes recapping the Tri-Party Council meeting from Oct 12th, 2021:

1. **_Update on the Sept. 28th sewage spill:_** This was due to a cracked 2” PVC clean out pipe off the force main. This has likely been a problem since the bypass was installed but was not detected during their testing. 900 gallons of sewage was spilled but did not go into surface waters.
2. **_CEO of ONSWC,_** has advised that the SD East Pump Station is still unfinished. He has indicated there may be a delay in the plant expansion. Mr. McDonald has not signed off on spray irrigation permit. He has also hinted that there might be some delay in the plant expansion; he has not signed off on spray irrigation permit (and appears to be holding off until Newland gets confirmation of at least 450,000 gpd capacity). As a result of this, Encore is still being watered with potable water.
3. **_No update on the aerial sewer pipes_** – awaiting report from structural engineer.
4. **_One more irrigation system test_** at intersection of Saxapahaw Run and Briar Chapel Pkwy. Testing of Ammonia Nitrogen, BOD and Fecal Coliform was within accepted NCDEQ limits.
5. **_BCCA is starting to raise issues with Newland at these meetings_**. In September, the BCCA mentioned landscaping deficiencies in the property that has been transferred to the BCCA. Newland said that it was not their responsibility. This month the BCCA raised the issue of sidewalk completion and repair. No response was noted from Newland.
6. **_ONSWC raised the issue of improper trail maintenance_** resulting in ponding and muddy conditions during irrigation. Tom Speer agreed that BCCA and TORC will meet to find a solution to the problem. Meeting notes say that the agreement between BCCA and TORC makes TORC responsible for the design and upkeep of the trails.

**November 15th Chatham County Board of Commissioners (CCBOC) Meeting – Fearrington Preserve**  
   
 At the November 15th CCBOC meeting, Fearrington Preserve’s application for a map amendment to the Compact Community Ordinance (CCO) was presented for final approval. Approval of this application would allow Congruus to apply for development under the CCO – which encourages them to use existing wastewater systems in their surrounding area (i.e., Briar Chapel). The CC Planning Dept recommended approval and the CC Planning Board (made up of resident volunteers) recommended denial.  
   
 In the November 15th CCC meeting, residents were granted the right to speak out despite recent rule changes regarding Public Input on these types of proposals. During public input section, there were four speakers from Briar Chapel (Liz Rolison, Rusty Field, Jennifer Drake and Stacey Donelan), three from Fearrington Village (Rose Krasnow, Tony Carroll, and Vickie Shea) and two others from neighboring communities who spoke in opposition to the proposal.  
   
 In addition, there were 36 written letters of opposition sent ~~in~~ to the CCC (22 from Fearrington Village, 8 from Briar Chapel and 6 from other communities).  
   
 When the Congruus application for the CCO map amendment was voted upon, the motion to approve did not pass (2-3) {Mike Dasher and Jim Crawford voted for; Karen Howard, Diana Hales and Franklin Gomez voted against}. A motion was then made to deny the amendment and it also did not pass (2-3) {Karen Howard and Diana Hales voted for; Mike Dasher, Jim Crawford and Franklin Gomez voted against}.  
   
 Franklin Gomez has asked Congruus to provide responses to the concerns/issues raised by the Planning Board noting that the Planning Board voted to deny the application. We would expect that Congruus will work to address Mr. Gomez’s concerns and will be back before the CCBOC in the next few months.  
   
 **_We are extremely thankful for everyone who showed up at the meeting, spoke in opposition and submitted written comments. This public action did and does make a difference._**  
   
 **Wastewater (WW) Study Commission**

**___________________________________________________**  
**Mission Statement**  
 StopChathamNorth is an incorporated non-profit 501(c)(4) social welfare association representing concerned homeowners within Briar Chapel. **StopChathamNorth does NOT support a regional wastewater treatment plant within the residential community of Briar Chapel.** We are aware of several new communities surrounding Briar Chapel that are planning to utilize our WWTP. We are opposed to all these plans to expand Briar Chapel’s WWTP for uses outside of the Briar Chapel residential community. We also believe that the WWTP and ONSWC must be fully compliant with all governance and regulatory guidelines to ensure operations do not create a nuisance, unhealthy or hazardous conditions for Briar Chapel residents.
