**StopChathamNorth (SCN)**

To the Residents of Briar Chapel,

In this email you will find information about:

1\. **Sewage spill in the area** where the new force main bypass connects to the SD-East force main (between Tyner Loop and the Dog Park off Great Ridge Parkway).

2\. NCDEQ notifies ONSWC of intent to issue a penalty for the unauthorized discharge of 345,000 gallons of reclaimed water onto Briar Chapel property.

3\. Updates on the upcoming October 5th Chatham County Planning Board meeting, which includes Fearrington Preserve, Vickers Village and Herndon Farm. **Fearrington Preserve has not yet finalized its plans for wastewater but hopes to request a contiguous service area extension to connect to either Briar Chapel’s or Fearrington Village’s WW system.**

4\. Updates on the Tri-Party Council.

**Sewage Spill off Great Ridge Parkway (between Tyner Loop and Dog Park)**

On Tuesday, September 28th a resident reported a sewage spill off Great Ridge Parkway, between Tyner Loop and the Dog Park. This area is where the new force main bypass connects to the SD-East force main. The spill is bubbling up through the ground and then running downhill over the walking trail and into the woods towards Pokeberry Creek. ONSWC was alerted and Chip White, our new operator in charge (ORC) responded quickly. The area has been taped off to prevent residents from walking or riding through that area. ([Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhZDchO8GOXIMhu159qmmJ_hm6F417DX/view?usp=sharing))

This is the 34th sewage spill that has occurred in Briar Chapel and the 2nd sewage spill since the force main bypass was implemented. This bypass was designed to reroute sewage to the SD East force main to bypass the problematic force main A that has been the site of the majority of our past spills. Crews are actively digging in this area to find the source of the spill. We are awaiting word from ONSWC on the cause of this spill.

**NCDEQ Plans to Issue Penalty to ONSWC**

On August 5th [NCDEQ sent a letter to ONSWC](https://edocs.deq.nc.gov/WaterResources/DocView.aspx?id=1998215&dbid=0&repo=WaterResources) notifying them that they plan to issue a penalty for the unauthorized spill of 345,000 gallons of reclaimed water onto Briar Chapel property. This spill occurred when a flush valve for the spray irrigation system was left on in a wooded area off Catullo Road on July 11th – July 14th. According to this letter ONSWC will be fined up to $25,000 for this offense.

**October 5th CC Planning Board – Fearrington Preserve, Vickers Village and Herndon Farms**

The October 5th CC Planning Board meeting is going to include several new development projects and proposals:

· Application for [Fearrington Preserve](https://www.chathamcountync.gov/government/departments-programs/planning/rezonings-subdivision-cases/2021-items/fearrington-preserve-congruus-cco-text-and-map-amendment) to expand the Compact Community map to include all of the Fearrington Preserve property. **Fearrington Preserve has not yet finalized its plans for wastewater but hopes to request a contiguous service area extension to connect to either Briar Chapel’s or Fearrington Village’s WW system.** This request has already been recommended for approval by the Chatham County Planning Department. ([Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1efkG9PXpVSQF-dpV-U57bbNPutzB7rv0/view?usp=sharing))

· Application for the [first plat for Herndon Farms](https://www.chathamcountync.gov/government/departments-programs/planning/rezonings-subdivision-cases/2021-items/herndon-farms-first-plat) a 55+ community planned just north of Briar Chapel on the east and west side of 15/501. ([Map](https://www.chathamcountync.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/57235/637667725893470000)) This community is proposing to build their WWTP that will serve only their community and will be located adjacent to Briar Chapel, north of the power line easement near the bike skills park and Veranda.

· Application for Vickers Village [rezoning request](https://www.chathamcountync.gov/government/departments-programs/planning/rezonings-subdivision-cases/2021-items/vickers-village-cco-rezoning) and [first plat](https://www.chathamcountync.gov/government/departments-programs/planning/rezonings-subdivision-cases/2021-items/vickers-village-first-plat). This is a compact community with residential and commercial property located between Jack Bennett Road and Vickers Road up to 15/501 across from Briar Chapel’s entrance. Vickers Village is proposing to build their own WWTP that will serve only their community. ([Map](https://www.chathamcountync.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/57367/637667792886470000))

Fearrington Preserve, Herndon Farms and Vickers Village are contiguous to Briar Chapel property. **This is important because if the owner of the Briar Chapel WW system (ONSWC) were to decide to expand service to these contiguous areas, it is a relatively easy process to get approval from the state (NC Utilities Commission).**

**Status Update on Tri-Party Agreement**

Here’s the latest information we have on the status of the work outlined in the Tri-Party Agreement:

· At the August 17th Tri-Party Council, BCCA reported on their recent opposition at the August 16th CC BOC meeting to a proposal from Fearrington Preserve to request a contiguous service extension to Briar Chapel’s WW system. **_SCN Comment: There is no indication in the meeting notes of any further discussion or position from ONSWC._**

· Work on the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) expansion to 500,000 gpd is on schedule and expects to be completed by the end of the year. NCDEQ has approved the permit to allow the odor control improvements to be added as part of this expansion.

· NC DEQ has issued the permit approving additional spray irrigation packages H, I, and J which when constructed, certified, and fully operational will provide up to 552,806 gpd capacity to our spray irrigation system. Construction for Package H has begun and covers property around the Western retention pond and near the end of Logbridge Rd. This area will be heavily irrigated and **will not** allow trails in these spray irrigation areas. Packages I and J include: conversion of Encore homeowner irrigation from potable to reclaimed water, Encore common areas and the woods surrounding Encore, behind Cliffdale/Whispering Wind and the Sports Courts area. **_SCN Comment: The permit does not allow year-round irrigation for some zones within the community and does not allow use of the irrigation system during major rain events or during freezing temperatures. It also discourages the growth of edible crops: vegetables, herbs and fruit trees in areas that are irrigated with reclaimed water unless they are thermally processed before consumption._**

· Over the last six weeks, SCN has seen an increase in the number of odor complaints surrounding the BC WWTP. According to the August 17th TPC meeting notes, ONSWC did not have a specific explanation, but surmised it had to do with the very hot weather and increased winds.

· The BCCA published their first two tests of the irrigation system this year: July 14th at Boulder Park and on July 28th at median on BC Parkway and Serenity Hill. They tested for ammonia-nitrogen, BOD and fecal coliform. Both tests were within contaminant limits for effluent at WWTP set by NCDEQ.

· ONSWC verified that the encasement pipe on the aerial sewer lines over Pokeberry Creek extends for 100 ft in one direction and 200 feet in the other direction. A structural engineer is now being engaged to determine what actions should be taken to assure the integrity of the pipe.

· Work on the SD-East Pump station was scheduled to be completed in August 2021. This pump station will be used by the commercial areas under development by Newland east and west of 15/501 near Taylor Road.

· [Meeting notes](https://www.briarchapellife.com/ResourceCenter/Download/44435/tpc%20report%20final?doc_id=2955775&print=1&view=1) were posted for the August 17th meeting. The last meeting of the Tri-Party Council was on September 14th. Meeting notes are not yet available from that meeting. The next meeting of the Tri-Party Council is scheduled for October 11th.

**Mission Statement**

StopChathamNorth is an incorporated non-profit 501(c)(4) social welfare association representing concerned homeowners within Briar Chapel. **StopChathamNorth does NOT support a regional wastewater treatment plant within the residential community of Briar Chapel.** We are aware of several new communities surrounding Briar Chapel that are planning to utilize our WWTP. We are opposed to all of these plans to expand Briar Chapel’s WWTP for uses outside of the Briar Chapel residential community. We also believe that the WWTP and ONSWC must be fully compliant with all governance and regulatory guidelines to ensure operations do not create a nuisance, unhealthy or hazardous conditions for Briar Chapel residents.
